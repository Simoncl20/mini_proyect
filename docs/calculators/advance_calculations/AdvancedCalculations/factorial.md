## `factorial(n: int) -> int`

#### Description:
This method calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using the Calculator's factorial method. This method belongs to the class AdvancedCalculations.

#### Parameters:
- `n` (`int`): The non-negative integer for which the factorial needs to be calculated.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The factorial value of the given non-negative integer.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Calculate the factorial of 5
result_case1 = factorial(5)
print(result_case1)

# Calculate the factorial of 10
result_case2 = factorial(10)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method internally uses the Calculator's factorial method to calculate the factorial of the given non-negative integer.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This method depends on the Calculator class from the calculator module. The Calculator class provides the factorial method used to calculate the factorial of the given non-negative integer.
