## `pythagorean_theorem(a: Type, b: Type) -> ReturnType`

#### Description:
This method calculates the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. This method belongs to the class AdvancedCalculations.

#### Parameters:
- `a` (`Type`): Represents one side of the right triangle.
- `b` (`Type`): Represents the other side of the right triangle.

#### Returns:
- `ReturnType`: The length of the hypotenuse in the right triangle.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to calculate the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle
calc = AdvancedCalculations()
result_case1 = calc.pythagorean_theorem(3, 4)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case
result_case2 = calc.pythagorean_theorem(5, 12)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method takes in the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle, `a` and `b`. It then uses the Calculator class to perform the necessary calculations to find the length of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, the method calculates `a^2 + b^2`, takes the square root of the result, and returns the length of the hypotenuse.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This method depends on the Calculator class to perform mathematical calculations.
