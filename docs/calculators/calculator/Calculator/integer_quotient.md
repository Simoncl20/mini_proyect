## `integer_quotient(a: int, b: int) -> int`

#### Description:
This method calculates the integer quotient of the division of a by b. This method belongs to the class Calculator.

#### Parameters:
- `a` (`int`): The dividend.
- `b` (`int`): The divisor.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The integer quotient of the division of a by b.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
calculator = Calculator()
result_case1 = calculator.integer_quotient(10, 3)
print(result_case1)  # Output: 3

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = calculator.integer_quotient(15, 2)
print(result_case2)  # Output: 7
```

#### How it Works:
The method uses the floor division operator `//` to calculate the integer quotient of the division of `a` by `b`. The floor division operator returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the division result.

#### Dependencies:
This method does not have any dependencies.
