## `binomial_coefficient(n: int, k: int) -> int`

#### Description:
This method calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose k) and is used to determine the number of possible combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. This method belongs to the class `Calculator`.

#### Parameters:
- `n` (`int`): The total number of items in the set.
- `k` (`int`): The number of items to be chosen.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The calculated binomial coefficient (n choose k).

#### Exceptions:
- None

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to calculate the binomial coefficient
calculator = Calculator()
result_case1 = calculator.binomial_coefficient(5, 2)
print(result_case1)  # Output: 10

result_case2 = calculator.binomial_coefficient(10, 3)
print(result_case2)  # Output: 120
```

#### How it Works:
- The method first checks if the arguments `n` and `k` are valid. If either `n` or `k` is negative or if `k` is greater than `n`, an error message is printed and `None` is returned.
- If the arguments are valid, the method uses the `factorial` method from the same `Calculator` class to calculate the factorial of `n`, `k`, and `n - k`.
- The method then calculates the binomial coefficient by dividing the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorials of `k` and `n - k`.
- The calculated binomial coefficient is returned.

#### Dependencies:
- `factorial`: This method is used to calculate the factorial of a given number.
