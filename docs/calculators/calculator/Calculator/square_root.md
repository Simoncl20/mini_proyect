## `square_root(number: float) -> float`

#### Description:
This method calculates the square root of a given number. This method belongs to the class Calculator.

#### Parameters:
- `number` (`float`): The number for which the square root needs to be calculated.

#### Returns:
- `float`: The square root of the given number.

#### Exceptions:
- `None`: If the given number is negative, an error message is printed and None is returned.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to calculate the square root of a number
calculator = Calculator()
result_case1 = calculator.square_root(9)
print(result_case1)
# Output: 3.0

result_case2 = calculator.square_root(-4)
print(result_case2)
# Output: Error: Cannot calculate the square root of a negative number.
#         None
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the given number is negative. If it is, an error message is printed and None is returned. Otherwise, it uses the math.sqrt() function to calculate the square root of the number.

#### Dependencies:
- math: This method uses the math.sqrt() function from the math module to calculate the square root of a number.
