## `remainder(a: Any, b: Any) -> Any`

#### Description:
This method calculates the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`. This method belongs to the class `Calculator`.

#### Parameters:
- `a` (`Any`): The dividend.
- `b` (`Any`): The divisor.

#### Returns:
- `Any`: The remainder of the division.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
result_case1 = remainder(10, 3)
print(result_case1)
# Output: 1

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = remainder(15.5, 4)
print(result_case2)
# Output: 3.5
```

#### How it Works:
The method calculates the remainder of the division of `a` by `b` using the modulus operator `%`. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division operation.

#### Dependencies:
This method does not have any dependencies.
