## `logarithm(number: float, base: float = 10) -> float`

#### Description:
This method calculates the logarithm of a number in a specific base (default is base 10). This method belongs to the class Calculator.

#### Parameters:
- `number` (`float`): The number for which the logarithm needs to be calculated.
- `base` (`float`): The base of the logarithm. Default value is 10.

#### Returns:
- `float`: The calculated logarithm value.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
calculator = Calculator()
result_case1 = calculator.logarithm(100, 10)
print(result_case1)
# Output: 2.0

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = calculator.logarithm(16, 2)
print(result_case2)
# Output: 4.0
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the provided number and base are valid for logarithm calculation. If either the number or the base is less than or equal to 0, or the base is equal to 1, an error message is printed and None is returned. Otherwise, the method uses the math.log() function to calculate the logarithm of the number with the given base.

#### Dependencies:
- `math`: This method uses the math module to perform the logarithm calculation.
