## `subtract(a: Any, b: Any) -> Any`

#### Description:
This method performs subtraction and is used for subtracting two numbers. This method belongs to the class Calculator.

#### Parameters:
- `a` (`Any`): The first number to be subtracted.
- `b` (`Any`): The second number to be subtracted.

#### Returns:
- `Any`: The result of subtracting `b` from `a`.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
calc = Calculator()
result_case1 = calc.subtract(5, 3)
print(result_case1)  # Output: 2

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = calc.subtract(10, 7)
print(result_case2)  # Output: 3
```

#### How it Works:
The method takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input parameters and subtracts `b` from `a`. The result of the subtraction operation is then returned.

#### Dependencies:
