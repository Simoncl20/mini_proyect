## `divide(a: Any, b: Any) -> Union[float, None]`

#### Description:
This method performs division and is used for dividing two numbers. This method belongs to the class Calculator.

#### Parameters:
- `a` (`Any`): The dividend.
- `b` (`Any`): The divisor.

#### Returns:
- `Union[float, None]`: The result of the division. Returns None if the divisor is 0.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
calculator = Calculator()
result_case1 = calculator.divide(10, 2)
print(result_case1) # Output: 5.0

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = calculator.divide(5, 0)
print(result_case2) # Output: None
```

#### How it Works:

The method first checks if the divisor `b` is equal to 0. If it is, it prints an error message "Error: Cannot divide by zero." and returns None. Otherwise, it performs the division of `a` by `b` using the `/` operator and returns the result.

#### Dependencies:
This method does not have any dependencies.
