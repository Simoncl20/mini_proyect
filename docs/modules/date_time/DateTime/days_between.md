## `days_between(start_date: datetime.date, end_date: datetime.date) -> int`

#### Description:
This method calculates the number of days between two dates. This method belongs to the class DateTime.

#### Parameters:
- `start_date` (`datetime.date`): The starting date for calculating the number of days.
- `end_date` (`datetime.date`): The ending date for calculating the number of days.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The number of days between the start_date and end_date.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
start_date = datetime.date(2021, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime.date(2021, 1, 5)
result_case1 = days_between(start_date, end_date)
print(result_case1)
# Output: 4

# Another use case (if applicable)
start_date = datetime.date(2021, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime.date(2021, 1, 10)
result_case2 = days_between(start_date, end_date)
print(result_case2)
# Output: 9
```

#### How it Works:
The method calculates the number of days between the start_date and end_date by subtracting the start_date from the end_date using the '-' operator. The result is a timedelta object. The days attribute of the timedelta object is then accessed using the days attribute, which returns the number of days as an integer.

#### Dependencies:
This method does not have any dependencies.
