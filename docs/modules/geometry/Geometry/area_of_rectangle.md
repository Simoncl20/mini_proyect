## `area_of_rectangle(length: float, width: float) -> float`

#### Description:
This method calculates the area of a rectangle. It is used to determine the total surface area of a rectangle with given length and width. This method belongs to the class Geometry.

#### Parameters:
- `length` (`float`): The length of the rectangle.
- `width` (`float`): The width of the rectangle.

#### Returns:
- `float`: The calculated area of the rectangle.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 5 and width 10
result_case1 = area_of_rectangle(5, 10)
print(result_case1)

# Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 3.5 and width 2.5
result_case2 = area_of_rectangle(3.5, 2.5)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method uses the provided length and width to calculate the area of the rectangle. It multiplies the length and width using a calculator object and returns the result.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This method depends on the Calculator class from the calculators.calculator module. The Calculator class provides the multiply method used to calculate the area.
