## `area_of_triangle(base: float, height: float) -> float`

#### Description:
This method calculates the area of a triangle. It belongs to the class Geometry.

#### Parameters:
- `base` (`float`): The length of the base of the triangle.
- `height` (`float`): The height of the triangle.

#### Returns:
- `float`: The area of the triangle.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
geometry = Geometry()
result_case1 = geometry.area_of_triangle(5.0, 6.0)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
result_case2 = geometry.area_of_triangle(3.0, 4.0)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:

The method calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: base * height / 2. It uses the Calculator class to perform the multiplication and division operations.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: The Calculator class is used to perform the multiplication and division operations.
