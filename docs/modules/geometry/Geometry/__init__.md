## `__init__(self) -> None`

#### Description:
This method initializes an instance of the `Geometry` class. It creates a new instance of the `Calculator` class and assigns it to the `calculator` attribute of the `Geometry` instance.

#### Parameters:
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Returns:
This method does not return any value.

#### Exceptions:
This method does not throw any exceptions.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Creating a new instance of the Geometry class
geometry = Geometry()
```

#### How it Works:
The `__init__` method is called automatically when a new instance of the `Geometry` class is created. It initializes the instance by creating a new `Calculator` object and assigning it to the `calculator` attribute of the instance.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This method depends on the `Calculator` class from the `calculators.calculator` module. The `Calculator` class is used to perform mathematical calculations in the `Geometry` class.
