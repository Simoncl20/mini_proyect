## `Geometry`

#### Description:
This class represents a concept of geometry and provides functionalities for performing geometric calculations.

#### Attributes:
This class does not have any attributes.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case of instantiating and using the class
instance = Geometry()
# The rest of the example
```

#### How it Works:

The `Geometry` class is used to perform geometric calculations. It does not have any attributes, but it contains methods to calculate various properties of geometrical shapes such as area, perimeter, volume, etc. The class can be instantiated without any arguments and the methods can be called on the instance to perform the desired calculations.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This class is imported from the `calculator` module and is used for performing mathematical calculations required for the geometric calculations.
