## `variance(numbers: List[float]) -> float`

#### Description:
This method calculates the variance of a list of numbers. This method belongs to the class Statistics.

#### Parameters:
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list of numbers for which the variance needs to be calculated.

#### Returns:
- `float`: The variance of the given list of numbers.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to calculate the variance of a list of numbers
stat = Statistics()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = stat.variance(numbers)
print(result)
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the `numbers` list is empty. If it is empty, the method returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the numbers using the `mean` method from the same class. Then, it subtracts the mean from each element in the `numbers` list, squares the result, and sums up all the squared differences. Finally, it divides the sum by the length of the `numbers` list to get the variance.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This method depends on the `power` method from the `Calculator` class to calculate the squared differences.
