## `standard_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float`

#### Description:
This method calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers. This method belongs to the class Statistics.

#### Parameters:
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list of numbers for which the standard deviation needs to be calculated.

#### Returns:
- `float`: The calculated standard deviation of the given list of numbers.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
statistics = Statistics()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result_case1 = statistics.standard_deviation(numbers)
print(result_case1)

# Output: 1.4142135623730951

# Another use case (if applicable)
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
result_case2 = statistics.standard_deviation(numbers)
print(result_case2)

# Output: 14.142135623730951
```

#### How it Works:
The method `standard_deviation` first checks if the `numbers` list is empty. If it is, the method returns `None`. Otherwise, it calls the `variance` method from the `Statistics` class to calculate the variance of the `numbers` list. The variance is then passed to the `square_root` method of the `Calculator` class (dependency) to calculate the square root. The square root is returned as the standard deviation of the `numbers` list.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This class provides the `square_root` method used to calculate the square root.
