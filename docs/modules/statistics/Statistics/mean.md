## `mean(numbers: List[float]) -> Optional[float]`

#### Description:
This method calculates the mean (average) of a list of numbers. This method belongs to the class Statistics.

#### Parameters:
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list of numbers.

#### Returns:
- `Optional[float]`: The mean (average) of the list of numbers. Returns None if the list is empty.

#### Usage Cases:

```python
# Sample code to demonstrate a common use case
stats = Statistics()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result_case1 = stats.mean(numbers)
print(result_case1)

# Another use case (if applicable)
numbers = []
result_case2 = stats.mean(numbers)
print(result_case2)
```

#### How it Works:
The method first checks if the list of numbers is empty. If it is, it returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the numbers using the `sum()` function and divides it by the length of the list using the `len()` function. The result is then returned.

#### Dependencies:
- `Calculator`: This method depends on the `Calculator` class from the `calculators.calculator` module. The `divide()` method of the `Calculator` class is used to perform the division operation.
